Buying a pellet grill? Just bought a smoker? Whether you have a Pit Boss, Traeger, Recteq, or one of the many other brands out there, here's the four smoker accesories I recommend to make sure you get off to a good start.

### Must Have Pellet Grill Accessories
  1. <a href="https://amzn.to/2NOWbR9" target="_blank">Lavalock Smoker Seal Gasket</a>
  * <a target="_blank"  href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00JO00S04/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00JO00S04&linkCode=as2&tag=smokydev-20&linkId=fd11b960a785a68d6a6cf36569ef553c"><img border="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&MarketPlace=US&ASIN=B00JO00S04&ServiceVersion=20070822&ID=AsinImage&WS=1&Format=_SL250_&tag=smokydev-20" ></a>
  * This self-adhesive product lines the edges of your pellet smoker lid with felt so that air (smoke) does not escape through the doors. Not only will this help keep the smoke **in** your grill, but it will help keep the outside of your grill looking clean by making sure smoke and grease only escape from the vents.
  2. <a href="https://amzn.to/3clERwC" target="_blank">US Wire and Cable 50ft Extension Cord</a>
  * <a target="_blank"  href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002HWRSAE/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B002HWRSAE&linkCode=as2&tag=smokydev-20&linkId=2b9ca844a49678e69d309c898bf4d2d2"><img border="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&MarketPlace=US&ASIN=B002HWRSAE&ServiceVersion=20070822&ID=AsinImage&WS=1&Format=_SL250_&tag=smokydev-20" ></a>
  * The cord that came with my [RT-590](/about) was probably 6ft long. I had to buy this extension cord to make sure I could better place my grill away from the house and neighbors.
  3. <a href="https://amzn.to/3ruYxmf" target="_blank">Bucket Head Shop Vacuum</a>
  * <a target="_blank"  href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07H84CHK2/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B07H84CHK2&linkCode=as2&tag=smokydev-20&linkId=510b8c58e41d38047a930958d1607dec"><img border="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&MarketPlace=US&ASIN=B07H84CHK2&ServiceVersion=20070822&ID=AsinImage&WS=1&Format=_SL250_&tag=smokydev-20" ></a>
  * cheap option to vacuum ash from the grill every ~40 hours
  4. <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/p/The-Home-Depot-5-Gal-Homer-Bucket-05GLHD2/100087613" target="_blank">5 Gallon Bucket</a>
  * used with the buckethead vacuum
