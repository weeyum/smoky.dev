## Maintenance
  1. <a href="https://amzn.to/31gxIaB" target="_blank">grease bucket liner</a>
  * disposable cups that fit nicely in the grease bucket so you can just dump it once it's full
  2. <a href="https://amzn.to/2NOWbR9" target="_blank">lavalock smoker seal</a>
  * adhesive felt to put around the lid of the smoker to make sure smoke gets directed to the vents instead of coming out the door.
  3. <a href="https://amzn.to/3vZjI3e" target="_blank">extra wide heavy duty aluminum foil</a>
  * line your drip pan with this so you can just rip it off after it gets gross
  * pork recipes tend to call for aluminimum foil wraps (as opposed to butcher paper)

## Organization
  1. <a href="https://amzn.to/3m0ikJb" target="_blank">kingsford charcoal kaddy</a>
  * holds pellets in a clear container that's easy to dispense
  * fits normal 20lb bags

## Cleaning Supplies
  1. <a href="https://amzn.to/3rlsSn8" target="_blank">grill floss</a>
  * fibers or bristles from brush-based scrubbers could come off and get into the food.
  * also helps clean **under** the grates.
  2. <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/p/Bucket-Head-5-Gal-1-75-Peak-HP-Wet-Dry-Shop-Vacuum-Powerhead-with-Filter-Bag-and-Hose-compatible-with-5-Gal-Homer-Bucket-BH0100/202017218" target="_blank">buckethead shop vac</a>
  * cheap no frills vacuum
  * used to vacuum ash from the grill every ~40 hours
  3. <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/p/The-Home-Depot-5-Gal-Homer-Bucket-05GLHD2/100087613" target="_blank">home depot bucket</a>
  * used with the buckethead vacuum
  4. <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/p/Multi-Fit-Replacement-Bag-Filters-with-Band-for-Select-Husky-Stinger-and-Bucket-Head-Wet-Dry-Vacs-3-Pack-VF2000/100058387">bucket head replacement filters</a>

## Cooking
  1. <a href="https://amzn.to/3clERwC" target="_blank">outdoor extension cord</a>
  * wirecutter #1 outdoor extension cord
  * must have because most pellet grill cords are very short
  2. <a href="https://amzn.to/3lOp9gE" target="_blank">butcher paper</a>
  * a lot of different recipes call for wrapping meat at a certain temperature to help finish cooking it in a reasonable amount of time
  * most beef recipes call for it (ribs, brisket)
  3. <a href="https://amzn.to/3vZjI3e" target="_blank">extra wide heavy duty aluminum foil</a>
  * line your drip pan with this so you can just rip it off after it gets gross
  * pork recipes tend to call for aluminimum foil wraps (as opposed to butcher paper)
  4. <a href="https://amzn.to/3slb8cX" target="_blank">black disposable gloves</a>
  * because all the cool chefs use black gloves for pictures
  * helpful because you don't need to go back and forth washing hands. essentially gives you one free pass after touching meat/grease to keep working before having to go inside
  5. <a href="https://amzn.to/3sokNPX" target="_blank">reusable glove liners</a>
  * liners to wear under disposable gloves to protect yourself from heat
  * great to pick up hot food straight from the grill without needing tongs
  * also helpful for maneuvering with probes
  6. <a href="https://amzn.to/3chvH4j">disposable aluminmum pans</a>
  * for transporting grilled food (or to give to neighbors)
  * also good for smoking things that require trays to catch drippings or juice (like pulled pork)
  7. <a href="https://amzn.to/3vV2jsh" target="_blank">water pan</a>
  * stainless steel is pretty nice so you don't have to keep using disposable ones
  * holds enough water for a 12 hour cook
  * intensifies [smoke flavor](https://www.foodfirefriends.com/water-pan-use/)
  8. <a href="https://amzn.to/2NR7I2z" target="_blank">bear mountain smoky gourmet blend 40lb</a>
  * had a low amount of dust
  * pellets were generally uniform in size and surprisingly they didn't break during shipping
  * good customer service when buying direct from the manufacturer. they accidently shipped me a 20lb bag but when I called them, they just shipped me the 40lb one no questions asked
  9. <a href="https://amzn.to/3chwcLJ" target="_blank">pellet smoker tube</a>
  * a tube where you can put pellets **inside** your grill to generate even more smoke
  * holds enough pellets to add smoke for a good 5 hours
